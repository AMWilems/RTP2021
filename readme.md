# Tanks: a Romulans Production 
> team comprised of Alexander Wilems, Nat Arney, Benjamin Marble, Adam Lamphier

>this program is meant to be a singleplayer 2D strategy and turn based tank arcade game. hope to add multiplayer after 1st sprint.
Our audience is ourselves, and anyone else who may find this game fun. 
we want to make this game to get a better feel for the design side of programming, and learning 2D game creation seems like something fun to learn for the group. we really have no goal for impact or change, just some fun.
